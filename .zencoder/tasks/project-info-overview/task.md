## Task Description
Create a comprehensive project information overview for the zencoder-render repository, which appears to be a task management API built with Express, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. The repository has a structure in place but many directories are empty, suggesting it's in an early stage of development or serves as a template/boilerplate.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] **Document Project Overview**: Create a README.md file that provides a high-level overview of the project, including its purpose, technology stack, and architecture.

- [ ] **Document Project Structure**: Create a detailed breakdown of the repository's directory structure, explaining the purpose of each directory and how they interact.

- [ ] **Document Setup Instructions**: Create setup instructions including environment configuration, database setup, and how to run the application in development and production modes.

- [ ] **Document API Endpoints**: Based on the existing code structure, document the planned or implemented API endpoints, including their routes, methods, and purposes.

- [ ] **Document Database Schema**: Create documentation for the database schema based on the migration files and models.

- [ ] **Document Development Workflow**: Document the development workflow, including how to run tests, linting, and the deployment process.

- [ ] **Create Architecture Diagram**: Create a simple architecture diagram showing the relationship between different components of the application.
